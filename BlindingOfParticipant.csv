Indeed, participants in the UC group initially paid more visits to the rheumatologist than participants in the Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) group. The participants' participation in the trial could have made rheumatologists aware of their participants' problems at work, and if a patient was allocated to the UC group rheumatologists might have thought they needed to act on account of their patients.

P,“Patients and personnel were blinded” (study author provided information)
N,"“Patients and providers were not blinded to the IFN, which could have affected reporting”"
P,"“Randomisation and blinding was done by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. Data collectors, outcome assessors and data analysts were all kept blinded to the allocation.” “The children were randomized to receive either single dose of 100 mg/kg oral chloral hydrate with one millilitre of intranasal normal saline as placebo (Group I) or 0.2 mg/kg intranasal midazolam with oral normal saline as placebo (Group II).” The participants and personnel were blinded to the appearance of the medications, as both were served (either one is placebo). Even though intranasal normal saline and oral normal saline (as placebo) taste differently from the medications, children would not be able to tell what the actual medications they received were. The investigators were not involved in the trial."
P,"“Randomisation at the level of participating physicians was used so that physicians would not see patients in both the intervention and control arms of the study, thereby avoiding contamination effects” (p. 448)"
P,“research assistants who were unaware of the intervention status implemented study procedures”
N,"“Sedative agents were prepared and administered by a trained nurse under the supervision of the attending pediatric neurologist in all patients.” “In groups D1 and D2, corresponding amounts of dexmedetomidine (Precedex 100 mg/mL; Abbott Laboratories, IL) in 3mL normal saline were given to patients via the oral route. In the D1 and D2 groups, patients received oral dexmedetomidine doses of 2 and 3 mg/kg, respectively. In groups C1 and C2, corresponding amounts of chloral hydrate (100 mg/mL) in freshly prepared, cherry-flavored liquids were given to patients in a single dose orally. In these groups (C1 and C2), patients received oral chloral hydrate doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively.” Blinding of participants is unlikely, as both medications are different in taste and quantity (amount served)."
P,"“The capsules of Rosa damascena extract were produced with the same appearance, colour and odour as Mefenamic acid capsules” “During the study, the participants and the researcher were unaware of the drug”"
P,"“The capsules were identical in shape, package, and colour, and were coded by the pharmacologist. Neither the researcher nor the participants were informed of the type of ingredient in each capsule.”"
Q,"“the EEG tracings were analyzed by two medical electro-encephalographers (EM, LT) who did not know what sedatives were administered and who were asked to review possible base alterations attributable to a sedative (impregnation), and to what medication it was attributed to” It is unclear whether or not participants and personnel were blinded."
P,"“The foods were presented to the mothers in jars, containing 71 g of food, and labels did not indicate the presence or absence of salt.”"
Q,"“The ginger and placebo capsules were prepared by a pharmacist. Briefly, fresh ginger root was chopped into small pieces, baked at 60°C for 24 hours, and then ground into powder. Ginger powder was weighed and 500 mg of it was filled in each capsule. Excess powder was wiped oC the capsule surface with a clean dry cloth. Both placebo and ginger capsules were packed in an envelope containing nine capsules.” Comment: it is unclear whether or not capsule appearance in both groups was the same in all aspects (e.g. colour)."
N,“The intervention group received 30 mg fennel capsules each 4 hours (8 am to 12 midnight) from about 3 days before menstruation till end of fiQh day for 3 months. There was no treatment for control group and they did not receive any placebo.” Comment: it was not possible to blind the participant to treatment as the control group did not receive any treatment.
P,"“The phyto-drug, ibuprofen and placebo were manufactured, standardized and packaged at Phyto-drugs Technology Research and Development Laboratory of the Mexican Institute of Social Security.” “All vials of medication (extract, placebo or ibuprofen) were identical and labelled with codes, which were known only to the investigators who manufactured the products.” Comment: participants were likely to be blinded as the interventions were standardised and packaged. All vials of medication were identical and labelled with codes, which were known only to the investigators who manufactured the products."
P,"“The placebo capsules contained toast powder. The capsules were similar in shape, taste and colour but one set contained 500 mg ginger powder per cap sule and the others were placebo capsules. The ginger capsules did not have 
distinguishable smell. The capsules were prepared in the Institute of Medicinal 
Plants and put into coded packages. Capsules and their packages were identical in appearance.” 
“This was a double- blind trial. Both the students and midwife providing care 
were blind to the treatment allocation. For this purpose, coded packages containing ginger and placebo capsules were used. The ginger and placebo capsules were identical in appearance, colour and taste.” 
“Students were asked to indicate a perception of pain intensity (most commonly) along a 10 cm horizontal line. Duration of pain was determined by asking each student to indicate the number of hours she had experienced pain 
during the first three days of the menstrual period.”"
N,"“The randomisations envelope was opened by the midwife when the patient entered the second stage of labour and was destroyed thereafter. The allocation was only shown to the midwife and the assistant, and if necessary the obstetrician.” Participants may have been blinded. Impossible to blind midwives but method of perineal care may have varied between midwives and affected outcomes."
P,"“The shape, size, and colour of the capsule of drugs were similar.” “The study was double-blinded, i.e. the researcher and students did not know which medication was administered.”"
P,"“This was a single-blind trial. The appearances of the experimental and control drug capsules were identical, and no aroma was detected from either”."
P,“trained interviewers who were masked to group assignment and study hypotheses and who had no role in the intervention interviewed them at 6 and 12 months.”
N,"”Subjects were not informed of their assignment until they had completed the first 16 wk of the study.” “All women were visited weekly during the first 4 mo postpartum to assist them in maintaining exclusive breast-feeding. Due to the nature of the intervention, both participants and personnel were aware of group allocation after 16 weeks."

N,"Quotation: “All the patients evaluated their burning mouth intensity with the same dentist” Comment: the study was unblinded to the participants.There was no mention of blinding - given that both arms employed completely different treatment modalities, it is unlikely that it would be possible to blind the participants or investigators"

Q,"Quotation: “This study was a doubleblind, randomized, longitudinal investigation” Comment: nothing further stated about the blinding procedure. Group C was a no treatment control group, thus knew which group they have been allocated, and were not blinded to treatment, however this treatment arm not relevant to this review"
N,"Quotation: “through the use of capsules of similar size and appearance so that just the support staff was the one who recorded the information until the end of the treatment (blind)” Comment: “similar size and appearance” unlikely that formulations were identical, as weights were different and they may not look the same. Unclear how preparations were provided to participants and in what packaging. Placebo only group involved 1 tablet while group 3 had 2 tablets to take - hence unblinding group 3 that they were on the combined treatment arm"

P,"Quotations: “A randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study design was adopted”; “Both patients and researchers were blind to treatment assignment (treatment/placebo)”; “The placebo consisted of a formulation (water and dye) identical to that of the study product but without the active agent”; “The products were coded by an operator external to the study in identical opaque containers (without any brand name)” Comment: probably achieved"
Q,"Quotations: “double blind study”; “Each patient was given a sealed envelope containing 32 tablets of 0.5 mg of clonazepam”; “Group B: 33 patients, placebo group. They were given 32 lactose tablets, of the same shape and size as those given to Group A” Comment: from information provided, blinding method appears appropriate - adverse effects (only reported in active arm “sleepiness in 5 patients of the clonazepam group, which did not require the clinicians to suspend the treatment”) and some participants in active arm reported sensation of effervescent and numbness for up to 3 hours - possible unblinding of participants due to side effects of clonazepam"

P,"Quotations: “Experimentors were blinded to patient allocation”; “All the tablets looked identical” Comment: side effects could potentially unblind participants, however, no significant difference in side effects reported between 2 arms. Unblinding mentioned: “After unblinding, five patients identified as clonazepam receivers .... ”- however, this was after the initial trial period of 14 days"
P,"Quotations: “placebo-controlled doubleblind crossover trial”; “Patients started with 200 mg of ALA or placebo (cellulose starch 100 mg), administered in identical capsules three times daily for 30 days” Comment: blinding of participants and key study personnel ensured, and unlikely that the blinding could have been broken. Side effects from ALA may have led to participants being suspicious that they might be taking the active treatment - results suggest no significant difference in reported adverse events between groups, hence unlikely that adverse events introduced significant bias"
Q,"Quotations: “The bottles were sealed and labelled with the study code and the enrolment number”; “When the study was complete, unblinding was carried out by an independent individual” Comment: it is unclear to the review authors at what point was the “study complete”; was it at the end of treatment or at the final session 5 visit?

Q,"To avoid possible contamination, subjects were advised that the purpose of the study was to examine the effects of injury on patients' responses to residential rehabilitation. Subjects were unaware of the experimental and control conditions employed in the study.' (p. 1034) However, it would not have been possible to blind the healthcare professionals who were involved in delivering the intervention to group allocation"
P,"to maintain blinding, the active and placebo tablets were identical in terms of appearance, taste and smell, as well as packaging and labelling"
P,"To minimise rating bias, investigators and patients were blind to the symptom severity threshold for randomisation. To preserve this blinding, patients who met the response criteria (MPS d 4 and no single item > 1) after the initial 8 weeks continued sertraline monotherapy in the randomised phase but were not included in the analyses of results from the randomised phase of the trial"
Q,"Tong 2014 noted that methods of blinding were not adequately described in the study, although a placebo control was used."
N,Treating physician not blinded as this was the person to allocate the participants.
Q,"Treatment allocation was not revealed to the participants or the providers. At hospital discharge, women were supplied their allocated medication in identical packaging. Pyridoxine tablets were white. Placebo tablets were white ""tic tacs"", which have a mint flavor. It is unclear whether tic tacs are sufficiently similar in appearance or taste to pyridoxine tablets to maintain the masking of treatment."
N,Treatment and control groups were given their pills on different days of the menstrual cycle
N,Treatment providers not blinded (p. 359).

P,Vaccine and placebo syringes were identical in appearance except for the allocation numbers.
Q,Vaccine vials labelled with letter codes instead of type/manufacturer details but unable to ascertain from study report whether vaccinators remained unaware of what each code represented
P,Vegetable and fruit intake Child’s vegetable and fruit intake unlikely to be influenced by performance bias
P,Vegetable consumption: Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to be influenced by performance bias
P,Vegetable crisps intake (objective): The children were not aware that their intake was measured or which condition they participated in and so the risk of performance bias is low
P,Vegetable intake (objective measure): Children’s vegetable intake was measured by weighing their plates before and after dinner (left-overs). There is a low risk of performance bias
P,Vegetable intake (objective) Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and staff were blinded to the target vegetable being offered to the children

P,Vegetable intake (objective): Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to be influenced by performance bias
P,"Vegetable intake (objective): The children and the daycare leaders were blinded to the treatment, i.e. they were unaware which product was high or low in energy and therefore low risk of performance bias"
Q,"Vegetable intake (weighed):Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to be influenced by performance biasParent reported fruit and vegetable consumption: There is no blinding to group allocation of participants or personnel described and this is likely to influence performance. However, it does appear that parents were blinded to the food provided to their children. “Researchers did not inform parents regarding which foods were presented to the children.”"
