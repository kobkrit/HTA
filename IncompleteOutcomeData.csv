Q,"According to Table 5, out of 67 participants randomized (33 to acupuncture and 34 to sham), 32(33) in acupuncture group and 30(34) in sham group were available at second follow-up (6 weeks after end of treatment). According to Table 5, only 41(67) were available at the 6 months follow-up (i.e. third follow-up) of which only 17(34) in acupuncture group and 24(33) in sham group were available at the third follow-up. No ITT analysis was applied. However, there were a relatively small number of dropouts in both groups (i.e. 5/67), and the withdrawals were unlikely to be related to knowledge of treatment assignment or effects of the treatment, because the participants could not tell the difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture. The degree of missing data would be unlikely to affect the estimate of the treatment effect."

,"Allaire originally had a 36-month follow-up which was extended with an additional year of follow-up. The main findings of this review are based on the outcomes of 12 and 24 months: in this time frame attrition was low.

During the original 36 months follow-up 4 participants dropped out of the intervention group and 6 from the control group, and one patient died in each group. The total reported attrition rate one year later, at 48 months, by Allaire was 18% in the intervention and 20% in the control groups.

Unable to assess incomplete data points for participants. ""Influenza vaccinations often are given in settings that do not generate claims, thus limiting the reliability of evidence of influenza vaccinations as seen via administrative claims."" Analysis of whether differential attrition could affect outcomes was not performed. The study was not designed to evaluate uptake of influenza vaccination as a primary outcome, and because it is possible that participants might have received influenza vaccination from a source that did not result in a claim being made to the insurers from which the outcomes were ascertained, there is likely underestimation of the influenza vaccination uptake for all 3 study groups. However, one might argue that one would not necessarily a priori expect to see systematic difference in utilisation of uncaptured sources of influenza vaccination between these groups unless there was differential dropout between the groups over time. No information was presented on people who might have dropped out because of death during the study or on those who might have lost their insurance benefits during the study period. This is a threat to the validity of both the cardinal outcomes and the analysis of secondary outcomes we performed."

It was unclear what the underlying reasons were for failure to obtain culture in these catheters, and whether the excluded data here were missing at random.Trialists excluded 88 further catheters because they were inserted beyond 72 h after discharge from ICU. These 88 catheters were evenly distributed among the 3 assigned groups (61 between the 2 chlorhexidine groups and 27 in the povidone-iodine group). However, following the construction of the best- and worst-case scenarios using the dropouts, the direction of the effect estimates swung from significantly favouring the chlorhexidine group (best-case scenario for chlorhexidine group) to significantly favouring the povidone-iodine group (worst-case scenario for chlorhexidine group). It was unclear whether the authors followed the intention-to-treat principle by analysing all available data according to the originally assigned groups, as there was no mention of participants who crossed over to the other group.We accorded the study high risk in this domain due to the high absolute dropout rate including the 179 catheters that were not adequately accounted for, as mentioned above, and the vulnerability of the result estimates to bestand worst-case scenarios"

Q,"Concerning data collection, incomplete outcome data seems to be adequately addressed by the sophisticated methodology used for the Nielson Scantrack and Homescan data, which is generally considered to be comparatively reliable. Concerning data analysis, study authors seem to have taken precautions to minimise problems arising from incomplete or imperfectly matched outcome data. Quote: ""The Scantrack data contain information on the weekly dollar sales and units sold of all UPC transactions at participating grocery, drug, and massmerchandisers in 2007 and 2012. These are point-of-sale data and do not include information about the individuals or households that products were sold to. Sampling limitations and representativeness are offset by using the Nielsen Homescan data. Nielsen Homescan data from 2007 and 2012 were used to track total caloric purchases and caloric purchases by U.S. households from each of the three brand categories. The Homescan data contain detailed UPC-level information about household food purchases brought into the home and cover all UPC transactions from all outlet channels, including grocery, drug, mass-merchandise, club, supercenter, and convenience stores"""

Q,"For RCT part of study n = 128 at 4 months (study commencement). By the end of study, 9 (8 in the EBF group) had dropped out with 119 completing study to 6 months. Mothers in the EBF group dropped out because: they moved away (n = 3), they went back to work (n = 2), they never intended to exclusively breastfeed (n = 1), they felt they were losing too much weight (n = 1). The 1 participant who dropped out of the CF group did so because she did not want to continue. There were no significant differences between the 119 participants and the 9 dropouts in infant sex, gestational age, ponderal index, or weight and length gains from birth to 16 weeks, nor in maternal height, BMI, income or prenatal care. However, dropouts had significantly lower birth weights, head circumferences, Apgar scores at 5 min, and maternal ages. Of those who remained in the study through 6 months, 44% were male, and mean values were 2364 +/- 137 g for birthweight, 23.3 +/- 3.3 kg/m2 for maternal BMI, and 5.7 +/- 2.7 years for maternal education. The sample sizes at 4 and 6 months for the blood indices analysed using frozen samples were smaller than those analysed immediately (Hb, Hct and MCV) because of a robbery (of the freezer with contents) at the Honduras facility near the end of data collection. This resulted in a loss of approximately 30% of the 4-month samples and approximately 30% of the 6-month samples. To determine whether these losses introduced bias, the authors evaluated whether the characteristics of those with lost samples at 4 or 6 months differed from those with complete data in either intervention group. There was little indication that the loss of samples introduced bias in interpreting the effect of the intervention. Nevertheless, data were analysed in 2 ways: considering only those with information available at both 4 and 6 months, and considering all samples available at 6 months."

P,"Incomplete and imperfectly-matched outcome data may have affected the effect estimates. Quote: ""For this paper, identification of HWCF products in each year was based on information on the brand and manufacturer of each Universal Product Code (UPC) provided by Nielsen Homescan. This approach differed from that used in the previous paper because it was not possible to reliably or consistently find information about the sales, acquisitions, joint manufacturing, or shared distributions of brands from the 16 HWCF companies going back to 2000. Additionally, it was not possible to apply the inclusion and exclusion criteria to reliably distinguish those products considered to belong to the HWCF companies across 13 years of data in a logical manner given mergers, acquisitions, and changes in distribution agreements across the companies"""

Because both ways of analyses revealed the same overall effects, the latter are reported in the results section' (Åsenlöf et al, 2005, p.596).

,"Losses to follow-up were disclosed as follows: of 131 eligible infants, 24 were excluded for having major congenital anomalies, gastrointestinal system anomalies, asphyxia, or sepsis, and parents of 19 infants refused to participate or were transferred to other wards. Of 88 infants randomised, 13 (9 in the prebiotic group and 4 in the control group) were transferred to other departments. The 13 excluded after randomisation appear to be attributable to reasonable attrition. However, the reasons for transfer, which could be related to outcomes assessed, were not stated. It also was not clear whether study authors compared baseline characteristics between participants included and excluded from the study. One loss to follow-up and 1 death occurred in each group, but these appear to be included in the analysis, although the 13 transferred to other departments were excluded, making it difficult to determine whether an intention-to-treat approach was used."

a total of 77,587 pregnancies, for which outcomes were not known in 10,239 
(13.2%). Of these, 9954 women were still pregnant when recruitment of live 
births in the trial was stopped; few pregnant women (285) had leM the area or 
died. Study authors recorded 5147 (6.6%) miscarriages/abortions, 1499 (1.9%) 
stillbirths, and 60,702 (78.2%) live births in the study area. According to plan,follow-up ended 6 weeks after recruitment was completed. Consequently, although almost all recruited live born infants were followed for the newborn

P,"Missing data have been imputed via appropriate methods. Quote: ""All analyses were intention-to-treat. For dichotomous outcomes, this meant that we assumed the negative outcome when the information was missing. For continuous outcomes, intention-to-treat meant that we retained data from all participants for whom the information was available. Full intention- to-treat including all randomised participants is not possible for continuous outcomes. Multiple imputations is not recommended when data are missing on dependent but not on independent variables, as it would only serve to increase standard errors. As a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome, we assumed no change for those where the outcome was unobserved. Distributions of scores and change scores were examined graphically, and if unusual outliers were found they were excluded in a sensitivity analysis."""

Intention-totreat analysis followed in all cases. More specifically: 'On the post-treatment measurement, eight patients dropped out: one from the UC [usual care] group and seven from BGA [behaviour-graded activity]. The UC patient disappeared after two treatments without stating any reason and was therefore assigned the mean values of the UC group. The two BGA patients withdrew from the study due to aggravated symptoms; negative scores therefore substituted their values. One BGA patient showed an exacerbation of symptoms before treatment and another BGA patient suffered from rheumatic symptoms, a disease he had not mentioned before randomisation. These reasons were considered not to be related to the postoperative treatment; therefore, they were assigned mean values. One BGA patient reported to be completely pain-free after two treatment sessions and was no longer motivated to continue the study, and one patient stepped out when resuming his professional occupation full time (without residual signs or symptoms) due to lack of time and motivation. One BGA patient withdrew because of personal circumstances and had actually recovered after five treatment sessions. The values of these three patients were substituted by positive values. After 6 months follow-up, 2 more BGA-patients dropped out: one underwent an operation for an intestinal disorder, and the other patient dropped out without obvious reasons and did not react to several voice mail requests. Both patients were assigned mean values. Another UC patient dropped out because of aggravated symptoms; negative values were used for substitution. After 12 months of follow-up, another BGA patient dropped out due to aggravated symptoms; negative values were used for substitution' (Ostelo, 2003, p.1760-1761)"

Q,"The analysis was per-protocol, but attrition was in an acceptable range (28%) and similar across groups. Quotes: ""2784 adults (1388 HIP, 1396 non-HIP) completed baseline interviews; data were analyzed for 2009 adults (72%) who also completed >= follow-up interview. (...) Post hoc tests confirmed that attrition from the SNAP did not significantly differ between the HIP and non-HIP groups. (...) There were some statistically significant differences between sampled persons who were or were not included in the final analytic sample (implementation wave, geography, sex of household head; sex, age, race/ethnicity, disability status, and marital status of sample respondent; Supplemental Table 1), and between those who did or did not complete >=1 follow-up interview (perceived barriers to grocery shopping; Supplemental Table 2). These losses to follow-up did not introduce imbalance across the HIP and non-HIP groups. All analyses incorporated sampling weights that accounted for survey nonresponse and attrition from the SNAP"""
P,"The analysis was per-protocol. Participants lost to follow-up differed significantly from those who stayed in the study, and it is unclear to what extent there was different attrition in the IG and CG. Quotes: ""Only complete case analyses were performed, meaning we analysed data only from children whose data from both time points was complete. (...) The non-response of parents to the parent questionnaire (complete case analyses only possible for 35%) is another limitation of this study. (...) We were able to conduct non-response analyses for the variables gender, grade and ethnic background of the child. Parents of children who participated in the study were more often parents of children in the lower grades (p < 0.001) and of children with a Dutch ethnic background (p < 0.001) as compared to parents lost to follow-up. Children who completed a questionnaire were more often children in the lower grades (p < 0.001) and children with a Dutch ethnic background (p = 0.007) as compared to children lost to follow-up. Children who were observed were more often children with a non-Dutch ethnic background (p < 0.001) as compared to children lost to follow-up. Non-response analyses were also conducted for the condition variable. Here we saw a difference between the intervention and control conditions in parents of children who participated in the study compared to parents lost to follow-up (p = 0.006) and for children who underwent observation compared to children lost to follow-up (p = 0.014)"""

N,"Where the study only gives an approximation as to the original number of randomised participants (N = 360), it is hard to identify the true number of participants that dropped out or that were included in the final analysis."
N,"While some limitations to the Nielsen Homescan data are discussed in the text, these data are generally considered to be a comparatively reliable source of representative household purchase data. It seems unlikely that incomplete outcome data substantially biased the results. Quote: ""We compare the demographics and locations of households who were in the panel during both periods with those who entered late or exit early. We find no statistically significant differences and conclude that sample attrition appears to be random"""
N,"While some limitations to the Nielsen Homescan data are discussed in the text, they are still considered to be a comparatively reliable source of representative household purchase data. It seems therefore unlikely that incomplete outcome data substantially biased the results (but note the issues discussed in the domain 'Other risks of bias')"
N,"While the commercially available Euromonitor sales figures are not perfect, they are generally considered reliable, and there is no evidence that problems regarding incomplete outcome data affected the 2 countries differently"
Q,"While the Nielsen Homescan data used in this study are not without limitations, they are generally considered to provide relatively reliable estimates for population-level purchasing behaviour"
N,"While the reporting of recurrence assumes no attrition or exclusions, the authors do not clearly report on whether there were any postrandomisation losses to follow-up, withdrawals, or trial group changes."
