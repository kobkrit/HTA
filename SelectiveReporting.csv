N,"“A slightly modified version of the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) osteoarthritis index was used as the outcome measure (Appendix 1)” at baseline, post-treatment and 8 weeks follow-up. From author: Their modified version had 16 questions rather than the full 24 questions. The major modification was that some of the function questions from the original WOMAC were dropped so that the questionnaire could be made shorter. Authors only reported WOMAC totals and not the WOMAC pain and function subscores. (unpublished information)."

P,"Comment: 2 secondary outcomes reported in protocol are not reported in results (self efficacy and daily functioning) 
Author response: ""With regards to the secondary outcomes; (a) 'daily functioning' has been included in the paper but has been renamed as 'functional 
impairment' (following the paper that was written on the development and 
validation of that scale); (b) 'self-efficacy' was included in the protocol, but 
no instrument was found with sufficient cross-cultural validity. As a result we 
have opted to include a 'coping scale (KID-COPE)', which was not included in 
the reporting because of unforeseen problems with the analyses (i.e. we were 
not able to adequately analyse the combined response format of dichotomous 
and ordinal scales per respondents of the KID-COPE)""

Q,"Comment: In the protocol, it mentioned several secondary outcomes that 
were not reported (social functioning, as measured by the Byumba Social 
Functioning Questionnaire. Social functioning will also be measured with the 
MOS Social Functioning Scale 36 items (SF-36); Social capital, as measured by 
use of the SA-SCAT. Alcohol use, as measured by use of the AUDIT-C. IPV, as 
measured by using elements of the CTS2S: the 'negotiation', 'psychological aggression', 'physical assault' and 'injury' scales"

Q,"Comment: the clinical trial protocol is available at ClinicalTrials.gov (Protocol 02484911). Some of the results are posted here. It is clear from the protocol that the outcomes changed during the trial process. Some of the original outcomes that were planned to be reported initially were not reported (e.g. QOL).

For weight perception outcomes, only the non-significance of changes is reported, without any more specific data. For beverage consumption outcomes only aggregate data for beverage groups are reported, which is explained by the study authors as follows: Quote: ""A fourth limitation of the present study concerns multiplicity of testing. Because there were many beverage and snack options available and all children were not expected to make changes in their purchasing behavior for all categories, we needed to examine each group of items separately. We did cluster the individual items into subgroups to minimize the problem of multiple tests, but the risk of Type I error remains"""
N,"For CGI, BPRS, and NOSIE, there were no data for the first cross-over phase; no SD was given."
Q,"For chocolate and plain milk selection, only numerical data are reported; temporal trends can therefore be assessed only for Power Plate selection, which is only an indirect measure for chocolate and plain milk selection. Apart fromthis, there is no indication that outcomes were reported selectively. Outcome data on all food and beverage items targeted by the intervention, and mentioned in the Methods section, are reported"
N,For efficacy outcomes there was no standard deviation or standard error indicated which had to be back calculated. Only adverse events with an incidence of more than 5% were reported. This procedure may have missed important adverse events.

N,H2RA given until ulcers healed but these data were not given
Q,Had intended to report AUDIT at all time points but do not. They explain that this is because of overlaps in reporting due to time frame component of AUDIT. Therefore alcohol frequency and binge frequency responses from interviews are reported instead
P,"HADS was not reported in results but was included in the secondary outcomes measures in the study methodology. This was unlikely to have an impact on the overall study outcome as this was not a key measure of depression and all other commonly used scales such as MADRS, HAM-D and CGI are reported. Protocol not reviewed."
N,"HAM-D score was dichotomized with no mean (SD) reported. BSI results not reported but not a major outcome of interest so unlikely to bias study outcome.

Q,"It is not reported if the study was registered, if a protocol is available, or ifanalyses were prespecified. Data were provided by Walt Disney with the under-standing that only certain outcomes are reported. This may have introducedbias.Quotes: ""Disney did not have complete data for Disneyland, located in Ana-heim, California; therefore, Disneyland is not part of this analysis. (...) Al-though raw sales data were provided for this analysis, access to these datawas provided with the understanding that only the percentages of differentkids’ meal items sold, as a function of the total meal items sold, would be pub-lished. Likewise, WDW [World Disney World] did not provide data for the num-ber of children who visited the park for fiscal years 2010–12 or the absolutenumber of kids’ meal items sold during that period. Reporting percentages isnot uncommon in the literature because of the proprietary nature of absolute numerical data for commercial businesses. In such cases where a company will not provide absolute numerical sales, the general convention has been to report differences in terms of percentages instead of as absolute numbers. Such an approach is common in health economics and psychology"""

N,Lack of definition of breastfeeding and particularly of EBF. The rates of EBF dropped from week 1 to 1 month then increased in the both groups in month 2 and dropped in month 3. This implies the definition of EBF was not in accordance with WHO guidelines. The control group of EBF may have received infant formula as only 53% of this group were exclusively breastfeeding by the end of week 1 and the amount of formula used in the control group in the first week was over double the amount used in the intervention group.

N,"Quotation: “adverse effects that appeared were very mild” Comment: clarification sought from contact author who provided adverse effect data. No baseline characteristics were presented for each arm of the study. Baseline anxiety and depression was presented for all participants but not for each arm. Outcome data were not presented in the prespecified way - graphs were presented which were difficult to interpret as the actual data values were not presented. The study authors combined “positive changes” with “full recovery” data for the active arms and “no change” with “worsened” data with the placebo - these outcomes should have been presented separately as combining them is very misleading. No useable data were presented for month 1, only month 2. Clarification sought from contact author who provided missing data from month 1"
N,"Quotation: “patients were clinically assessed every 15 days, and symptomatology was recorded” Comment: the above was prespecified but no data were provided in results Quotation: “without notable adverse effects” Comment: no prespecified method of assessing adverse effects was provided and above comment suggests some adverse effects were reported, but no data provided in results Quotation: “The study was concluded with a re-evaluation of the results 1 year after commencement of the trial” Comment: the study only analysed results for the participants who “showed an improvement at 2 months”, despite the methods section suggesting “Patients that reported any amelioration within 4 months (12 of Control group and 29 of Test group) were given further therapy for 1 month, with a protocol identical to that used previously”. Therefore the methods and results do not correlate with each other. One should expect that all participants should be followed up at 1 year, not only the responders"

Thirty-nine patients … did not complete the study and were excluded from the final analysis of efficacy at the 12th month.

Q,"The study protocol was not available. Whilst most of the outcomes stated in the methods section were reported in the results, the PEDIS data were not reported."
P,"The study report does not mention if the study was registered, or if the study protocol included outcomes that were prespecified. However, the study reports all outcomes mentioned in the Methods section, and all important outcomes which may be expected in a study of this kind, and which could be analysed with the data used, are reported"
N,The study report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
P,The study was registered (EudraCT 2009- 013268-38) and the outcomes by protocol versus reported were equal
N,"The thresholds for some outcomes (e.g. Apgar scores) were not reported in the Methods section, thought the cut-offs used are reasonable.• The base excess cut-off is stated as ≤ 12 in the primary outcome section, but is reported as < -12, which may constitute outcome switching.• The study protocol was not able to be located on ICTRP.• Maternal outcomes are reported in the text but not in the tables – some were reported as not significant but without data presented. The discussion mentions a difference in caesarean rate, but data were not presented.• A special analysis was undertaken comparing a subgroup of women in the intervention group who worsened against the control group. This was not prespecified. It is not explained why this was conducted."
N,The trial could not report all relevant oncological outcomes due to premature closure.
P,The trial describes clinically relevant outcomes. We had no access to information about outcomes described in the original protocol or information in trial registries.
Q,The trial registration reports a secondary outcome that is not reported in the outcome paper
N,"The trial registry entry for this study (www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3400) mentions 3 potentially important outcomes which are not reported in the study: waist circumference, snack consumption and intake of fruit. Moreover, results on the prespecified primary outcome (BMI) and the first of the 4 prespecified secondary outcomes (water consumption) are not reported in the Results section of the paper, but only in the annexe, with a short reference in the Discussion section of the paper. For the first of the 4 secondary outcomes prespecified in the trial registry entry the study's primary report states explicitly that it was not an outcome Quote: ""Although the intervention was aimed at reducing the intake of children’s SSB consumption by promoting the intake of water, water consumption was not an outcome measure of our study"")"
P,"The trial was registered after the start but before the end of the study, and all important outcomes mentioned in the Methods section are reported"

Q,"The trial was registered towards the end of the study, and no published protocol is available. SSB consumption and BMI were inclusion criteria and assessed, but are not reported in the main 3-arm comparison (the study does, however, report energy intake in kcal/day, waist circumference and body weight in kg as outcomes). The study does not report if outcomes were prespecified or not, and there are some differences between the outcomes listed as primary and secondary outcomes in the trial registry and those reported in the study reports"
Q,"The trial was registered, but only retrospectively. The protocol was published prior to its implementation, and mentions total grocery shopping purchases (collected through FlyBuys loyalty cards) as an outcome, which is not reported in the primary report. In particular, reporting on certain potential adverse outcomes, e.g. compensatory behaviour, might be incomplete due to confidentiality agreements. Quote: ""Our agreement with industry partners did not permit us to analyze substitution effects (i.e., whether and how the discount affected the purchasing of nontargeted products)"""
