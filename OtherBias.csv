Q,"""(Tables 1, 2 and 3). Using a non-parametric test for testing differences on demographic data between treatment groups yielded no significant difference among these groups (Table 7). With respect to the regimen of medication for each patient (Tables 4, 5, 6), there was close similarity in each group. The majority of patients in each group received either haloperidol or trifluoperazine; therefore any alternative treatment differences could not be influenced by medication. However, due to the formula which is used by physicians in dispensing medication, it was not possible to use a statistical procedure for testing the equality of the three groups in this study.

N,"""Although our study involved randomization and double-blind drug procedures to prevent bias, the small sample size resulted in some imbalances between groups at the first visit. Thus, the conjugated oestrogen group had less exposure to antipsychotic medication and a shorter duration of TD. They also had higher mean baseline AIMS scores than did the placebo group, thereby leaving more possibility for improvement in scores. The small sample size does not allow statistical analysis to adjust for these differences. Although we found a positive but non-significant association between duration of TD and decrease in AIMS score between visits 1 and 4, we doubt that TD duration is a confounding factor, since the direction of this association is the opposite of what we would have expected""."

N,"Comment: participants took part in at least 3-months of run-in where alterations to eating, exercise, glucose self-monitoring and medications were suggested. Compliance was measured during this time. The endocrinologist then independently determined when a participant was ready for randomisation Of 158 potentially eligible participants, only 60 were randomised. Reasons for exclusions before randomisation were noted No statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics Block randomisation used in an unblinded trial, which may be possible to predict assignments"

possibly because baseline data was collected just after 'Kao Pansaa' a 3- 
month Buddhist retreat where it is customary for people to avoid wrongdoing 
including reducing drinking"

The trial employed subjective measures only (e.g. Fred Hutchinson FFQ, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). Risk of recall bias due to the use of self-reported instruments. However, investigators also performed objective measures of weight, physical activity, and food intake in a subsample of participants (n = 202/1277) which were found to correlate well with self-reported measures"
Q,"Comment: there was baseline imbalance as the group of patients who received linezolid were significantly younger than those who received vancomycin (66 vs 76 years), this is unlikely to be clinically significant"
N,"Comment: there was differential use of nutritional supplements by patients in each arm, which could have biased the nutritional status outcomes, although it is not clear if this differential use was due to different levels of compliance or due to different levels of prescribing based on nutrition needs - which was part of the protocol for nutritional supplementation after surgery. Also, gastric bypass patients received a vitamin B-12 supplement while duodenal switch patients did not Furthermore, it is stated that the surgeons and multidisciplinary treatment teams were more experienced in LRYGB procedures than LDS, which may have impacted the results. Also, responses to questionnaire item about snoring in the sub-study (Olsen 2012) were re-categorised into different response options (a dichotomous yes/no) post-hoc during analysis"

In particular, this might have obscured relevant effects on compensatory behaviour (i.e. beverage consumption outside school), for which the study found no relevant effect. The same applies to weight perception outcomes: Quote: ""A third limitation is the lack of a comprehensive and detailed assessment of body dissatisfaction and unhealthy dieting and eating behaviors. It is possible that there were changes due to the intervention that our measure was not sensitive enough to detect. Future research examining the hypothesis that school-based interventions may increase weight preoccupation and dieting behaviors in a negative way should use measures that can detect subtle changes and distinguish between appropriate attempts to eat healthfully and inappropriate extreme dieting behaviors (such as fasting or purging)"""

N,"No information on overall hospital maternity population and cannot assess for selection bias. Publication implies that protocol was written and registered after the trial finished. Unclear definitions. Definitions of EBF varied. Trialists replied: ""The definitions varied in the time of data collection and the length of time considered for exclusive breastfeeding. Data collection “during hospitalization” considered the whole time from study enrolment to discharge from hospital. Only newborns who have not received any supplement during the entire time of this period were classified as exclusively breastfed. Data collection “at the point of discharge” was performed at the time of discharge home and babies were considered as exclusively breastfed if no supplement was given for at least 24 hours with adequate weight gain.... Mothers were interviewed at the time point of 3 and 6 months of age of their infant...Infants were classified as exclusively breastfed if no supplement formula was given for at least 24 hours."" Review authors queried the definition of a ""feed"". It is common for infants in the first few days to go to the breast 10-12 or more times in 24 hours; if the infant went to the breast 12 times, did the infant get 12 supplements of 10 ml? Trialists replied: ""Breastfeeding on demand is supported within our hospital and was enabled for all unless the mother wished otherwise, however newborns in the CLF group only received supplemental feed of 10 ml after breastfeeding every 3 hours, i.e. 8 times in 24 hours"". Review authors queried: what was the definition of ‘adequate milk production’ and who decided that ‘adequate milk production’ had started? Trialists replied: ""Mothers were checked for expressing milk and adequate milk production each day by experienced specialised nurse, although this was not done quantitatively"". Review authors queried Why was weight loss of 5% used? Trialists replied: ""As per the standard guideline of our hospital, weight loss of >10% of birth weight is considered as excessive and measures to prevent risk of dehydration are taken including begin of supplemental formula feeds. Thus weight loss of ≥5% of birth weight at the age of 24-48 hours was considered most suitable as inclusion criterion to select newborns who may be at risk, yet who are still within “normal limits” for physiological weight loss that does not strictly require intervention"". Trialist replied that artificial formula filled syringes were not provided by manufacturer and prepared in the maternity unit. The published paper lists funded by PRVOUK32. The Charles University Research Development Schemes. ""For the given effect size (population proportions of 0.95 versus 0.75) and alpha (0.052-tailed) with power of 0.80, the estimated sample sizes are 49 in each group. This means that 80% of studies would be expected to yield a significant effect, rejecting the null hypothesis that the two population proportions are equal."""

Q,"Number of women per group not reported. Quote: ""The etiology and duration of infertility were equally distributed among the groups."" No table of demographic characteristics available."
Q,"On average, women in the secondary care group were 1 year older than those in the primary care group. Authors also reported that there was a significant relationship between uptake of screening and age; “For those that were randomised to the secondary care setting… The probability of uptake of screening was high and increased further with age” ."
Q,"One centre used its own randomisation schedule and randomized 68 women (34 to each group), therefore assignment was not according to FHI randomisation schedule"
P,One participant received esomeprazole 40 mg twice daily. Funded by a Grant-in-Aid from the Riley Children’s Foundation
N,One participant with a complication was excluded
Q,One study author has financial interest in the company that has licensed IP for use of mifepristone in treatment of PMD
N,"Only 11/30 participants exhibited akathisia, and slight differences in baseline akathisia symptoms were noted between groups. Sample size was small and the intervention was of short duration"
Q,Only 68 (75%) in the intervention group received ECMO
N,"Only 7 participants given gestrinone and 9 participants taking danazol had repeat laparoscopy. If amenorrhoea was not obtained after 1 month of treatment, the gestrinone dose was increased to 2.5 mg 3 times a week (7 participants) and the danazol dose to 800 mg a day (2 participants)"

N,Only abstract available
N,"Only female participants could be included in the study; therefore, gender bias can not be excluded."
Q,"Only female participants could be included, so a possible gender bias cannot be excluded."
N,Only subsample with TD from one site included in this review
Q,"Originally. the trial planned to have a further follow-up point six months later, but this could not be carried out as psychiatrists had rotated away to different posts.The extent to which this could have biased the results is unclear."
P,Other bias Low risk No other bias identified.
P,Other biases not apparent
Q,Outcomes for elderly population not fully reported. Study designed for the general population; elderly subgroup analysis not planned
P,Outcomes not prespecified The authors' conflicts of interest were not reported.
N,Paradoxical reaction was only defined clinically by lesion size; no exams to support diagnosis.
N,Participants agreeing to open-label trial likely to be biased towards those who believed they had received initial benefit from treatment
P,"Participants could make more than one order, so each outcome is not necessarily independent, which may inflate the SE estimate. The data received from the authors were adjusted for covariates"
Q,Participants differed on child age by condition. However although this was adjusted for in the analysis the impact of this imbalance is unclear
Q,"Participants had a history of former intolerance to atypical antipsychotic treatment, but baseline data on this were not provided."
Q,Participants in both groups usually met with their case managers every six months to complete a six-month care plan. The intervention group in this study met with their case manager an additional time three months before their next six-month care plan was due. The results regarding satisfaction with service process could have arisen from the more regular client-case manager contact rather than anything specifically to do with the approach to goal planning that was used
N,Participants in placebo arm had H. pylori eradication at 8 weeks so 12 month follow-up not randomised
N,Participants in placebo group received on average lower dose of antipsychotic medication compared with intervention group
P,Participants recruited among volunteers
Q,Participants similar in baseline demographic characteristics but numbers not balanced at randomisation
P,Participants similar in demographic and infertility characteristics at baseline.
Q,Participants were men and unsure if gender selection bias occurred and the study lasted longer than 20 years.
Q,Patient-requested additional analgesia; time to mobilisation and duration of inpatient stay were not reported.
P,Patients equal at baseline for risk factors (communication with authors). No competing interests
N,Patients were either inpatients or outpatients and all data were combined together in analysis
P,"Patients were informed about the study preoperatively, and written informed consent was obtained."
Q,Patients were only followed up for 5 days; some infections would have occurred after this time. Baseline risk factors were equally distributed between groups
N,PBAC scores significantly higher in the surgical group at baseline
N,"PCR-negative cases (30 participants, 33%) may not be BU."
N,"Per the authors' report, this study was prematurely halted due to ""a combination of different factors in different centers, including the departure of key members of staff, and the erroneous belief that steroids had had such a dramatic beneficial effect that continued randomization of women was not justified""."
Q,Placebo group had a higher mean age and more patients with non-fatal underlying disease

Supported by Immunization Vaccines & Biologicals (the World Health Organization and the United Nations Foundation), Sight&Life (Hoffman-la Roche Ltd), Micronutrient Initiative, the Canadian International Development Agency, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)."
N,"Post hoc analysis; modified diagnostic criteria for TD were applied at baseline, and a 3-month history of antipsychotics exposure was not required"
Q,Potential conflicts listed that pharmaceutical companies involved in the production of pertuzumab funded parts of the study and had staff consulting on the trial
N,Potential confounders were not adjusted. Use of historical control may bias the results in favour of the newer treatment because of improvement in supportive care
N,"Potential contamination of control participants, who were being treated by the same primary care team that were receiving input from the palliative care team for the intervention participants."
Q,Potential exists for cross-group contamination
Q,"Potential impact of high attrition on ITT bias may be an issue, as the study did not use ITT analysis"
Q,"Power: not mentioned. Early cessation: quote: ""Group 4 (no treatment group, Derby) was stopped for ethical reasons when the serum paracetamol levels increased between the first and last samples in four out of five patients."" Intention-to-treat analysis: not mentioned."
Q,"Power: quote: ""Initial sample size estimation indicated that 249 patients were required for each arm of the study to detect an approximate halving of the rate, with 80% power. An incidence of 9% was estimated using the literature evidence available at study design."" Early cessation of study: quote: ""The initial research plan included 500 patients. The study was terminated in 2003 with 180 evaluable patients because of the difficulty in obtaining data in a reasonable time frame."" ""At a formal consensus meeting, the investigators concluded that a reduction in the observed rate of anaphylactoid reaction (from 25% to 10%) was required to justify a change in the guidelines for the initial reaction in 180 patients was only 4.3% (standard error = 5.5%). A sample size of more than 1,000 patients in each arm would be required to show the observed difference to be significant at an equal to 0.05 with 80% power."" Comment: early cessation for futility is not best practice but unlikely to have led to a biased estimate of treatment differences. Not recorded mean paracetamol level or mean paracetamol dose ingested, in each group. Known that increased adverse events from IV acetylcysteine at lower paracetamol concentrations, unknown if difference between the 2 groups."
Q,"Powering or intention to treat not specified. The first 2 reports of the study were interim analyses, the trial did not seem to have had any prespecified power analysis and stopped when the authors deemed other treatments were more promising."
P,"Pre-study power calculation was performed, and no other potential bias was observed"
N,"Pre-study power calculation was performed,.and no other potential bias could be observed"
Q,Preliminary results as 4 subjects had not completed the study.
N,Primary investigators described a significant drug by order and group by drug by order interaction.
N,Primary outcome data have to be imputed from percentages and exact denominators at 4 and 6 months follow-up are unclear.
N,Primary outcome was assessed by unblinded therapist making contact with patients by telephone
N,Procedures really comparable as in 2 of the 3 groups salpingo-oophorectomy was also performed. Pain score results must be interpreted with caution as different analgesics were used during the operation and postoperatively
P,Procedures were performed by 2 equally skilled and experienced surgeons using identical techniques
N,"Protocol as ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00952328 listed primary outcome as: Is infant receiving exclusively breast milk at 8 days of life, published paper refers to “1 week”. Protocol “Both groups will receive intensive lactation support” – published report does not mention “intensive” support. Small sample size. Only 62% of those replying (6 out of 40 did not reply) at the start of the intervention had planned to exclusively breastfeed which may have affected their motivation to comply with the allocation. There were more multiparous women in the intervention group than the control group (70% vs 50%) and previous experience of breastfeeding is a well-established predictor of subsequent feeding. Effect on weight was an outcome however, the study did not specifically weigh infants; used hospital routine weights, and only reported loss, not gain. Inclusion criteria was weight loss of ≥ 5% though this is well within the range of normality, and no infant in the study had a medical reason for supplementation. Unclear what was the support provided for breastfeeding, if mothers were instructed regarding how often to feed, to express milk if infant was not feeding well, etc. No information on birth practices that may have affected commencing breastfeeding. No definition of a “feed” thus the instruction to give the 10 mL of supplement “after each feed” could be 8 times, 12 times or more and thus variable quantities consumed. As supplement was given by syringe the infant was not able to refuse the supplement if already content with the amount of breast milk received. Funding: supported by grants 5 K12 HD052 and 1K23HD059818-01A1 from the National Institute of Children Health and Human Development. One of the trialists has served as a paid consultant to 4 companies in the formula industry including the company producing the supplemental formula used in the intervention. Report does not state if formula was supplied by the company or purchased; some participants were provided with small amounts of the formula to continue supplementation for a short time after discharge from hospital (""about 12 ounces"" from additional information from trialists)."

Q,Quetiapine dose range was below therapeutic range.
Q,Quotation: “Patients occasionally using anxiolytics to induce sleep were accepted” Comment: no data provided on baseline use of anxiolytics between groups - prespecified as inclusion criteria but not reported upon. Important data as could induce baseline inequality or act as confounder
Q,"Quotation: “Two patients who took the test substance reported exacerbation of the symptoms in the first week of treatment, but this was also observed in 4 patients in the control group” Comment: the text above is contradicted by the flow chart which states 3 patients in each arm reported exacerbation of symptoms"
N,"Quotations: “Three clinicians, with extensive experience in oral medicine, examined the patients”; “They were again scheduled for visits after 1 month and 6 months, which allowed the clinicians to monitor their evolution”; “Both groups of patients showed improvement, which was partially due to the psychotherapy. The management of patients with BMS should be focused on two aspects. On one hand, clinicians could treat the symptoms; on the other hand, they could use basic psychotherapy customized to each person, which can be carried out in our dental office. The aforementioned psychotherapy is focused on listening to the patient, emphasizing affectivity, security and tranquility, and transmitting the feeling that we know exactly what the patient is going through as well as the difficulties we face in giving him/her solutions to his/her problems. Our personal experience has shown us that, if we manage to calm the patient with our attitude, the possibility of improvement increases; this is particularly true in patients who are relatively stable from an emotional point of view” Comment: the above statements suggest that there was additional treatment in the form of psychological intervention for each participant, undertaken by 3 different clinicians. No mention of standardisation of consultations or calibration of clinicians, hence possible confounding factor in terms of “psychotherapy” provided in a non-standardised/uncalibrated way. Unclear if adverse events were recorded by investigators (see above) - possible unblinding of investigating clinicians, as a result of this which could influence the consultation and “psychotherapy” provided to each participant Quotation: “None of the patients was treated in the last month before their inclusion in the study” Comment: despite the above quotation, the authors reported most participants were taking adjuvant medications (e.g. antidepressants, anxiolytics) during the study. Therefore the former statement is misleading and inaccurate, as most would consider antidepressants and anxiolytics to be active treatments for BMS. No data were provided on type of drugs used, any dose changes during the study period - hence unclear whether there were confounder inequalities between groups during the study"
Q,"Quote (from report): ""...no improvement was found in the control group. Thismay have been due to the relatively short twice-weekly training, while effec-tive protocols reported in the literature utilized between three and five train-ing sessions per week""Comment: As the control group did not improve with pulmonary rehabilita-tion, the efficacy of the rehabilitation programme appears questionable. Thegroup that trained with non-invasive ventilation did improve. However, asboth trainers and participants were not blinded to the intervention, bias can-not be ruled out, although the progression of training intensity was standard-ised; this should have helped to ensure that participants were exposed to thesame type of training programme"

Q,"Quote from publication: “Our study has several limitations. First, the baseline BMI was significantly higher (47 vs. 45 kg/m2 , respectively) and age was significantly lower (41 vs. 45 years, respectively) in the gastric bypass group than in the gastric banding group. These differences occurred by chance though the randomization process” (Nguyen 2009). In addition, for complications, mean duration of follow-up differed (LYRGB 4.2 years, LAGB 3.6 years). No protocol to reduce the risk of differential behaviours by patients and healthcare providers in the absence of blinding was reported"
Q,"Quote: ''Because of difficulties encountered during the registration process in the European Union, the study sponsor elected to prematurely halt enrolment in the study.

N,Quote: “The one leak in our LGI group can be directly attributed to our lack of experience with the LGI. We are certain if our study had been conducted by one of the prominent LGI groups around the world the leak we experienced would have been avoided” Comment: a source of bias if the surgeons were consistently less skilled at gastric imbrication than sleeve gastrectomy but this only appears to have resulted in a serious outcome in one operation
Q,"Quote: “There were disparities in baseline demographics. Established prognostic factors differed between groups: more smokers were assigned to the paraffin tulle gras group, and more diabetics to the honey group.”. Comment: whilst the study report stated that there were more smokers assigned to the paraffin tulle gras group, the data in Table 1 (baseline demographics) indicates that slightly more smokers were assigned to the honey group but the difference was not great and unlikely to impact on the results (33% of the honey group were smokers in Table 1 vs 27% of the control group)."

Q,"Seasonality was taken into account; however, it is possible that compensatory SSB sales outside the leisure centres occurred.

Seasonality was adjusted for to account for seasonal changes in sales and because there was an unbalanced distribution of months before and after the intervention. (...) [I]t has not been possible to evaluate how the policy has affected purchasing behaviour outside of these venues. It is possible that some customers delayed the purchase of SSBs and visited other retail outlets to avoid paying the higher price. This explanation is less likely to apply to customers choosing to substitute for non-SSB products. Given that we observed a large increase in non-SSB consumption and overall sales did not decrease significantly, we believe that there would be limited delayed purchases of SSB products outside the venues which might mitigate the effectiveness of the policy"""

However the main outcome measure for the three month follow-up was manufactured for this study, and appeared to map onto the kinds of activities that would likely be generated from the COPM. The outcome measure at three years, the Dallas Pain Questionnaire (DPQ) appear to be added during the course of the study: 'In order to prevent reduced patient compliance, only the questionnaire composed for this study was used in the first three follow-ups. However, recent findings from a study with a similar patient category published in 2006u indicated that multiple questionnaires do not necessarily reduce patient compliance.

N,"The included participants were atypical of the psoriasis participant population as a whole, because they were more likely to have been treated with PUVA before and appeared to have more treatment-resistant psoriasis than non-participants. In other words, the baseline in both groups seemed to be unequal. In addition, the study withdrawal was extremely high, and withdrawal of 1 body-half for any reason inevitably caused withdrawal of the other half. Third, each participant received both treatment regimens, so the treatment to 1 side might have affected the other. All of these pitfalls might have induced other bias"

N,The mean number of drinks sold at baseline from comparison vending machines was substantially lower than in the intervention vending machine
N,"The methods used for outcome assessment seem to have been unreliable, as shown by the huge discrepancies between self-reported beverage consumption and beverage purchases - e.g. in the whole sample at baseline, participants seem to have purchased only 53% of the bottled water they consumed at Coles supermarkets, while they seem to have consumed only 13% of the SSB they bought there. The study authors raise doubts about the reliability of the self-reported data, and in the process evaluation it is mentioned that participants reported that even with the discount, beverages were more expensive at Coles supermarkets than in other shops, which is why they bought their beverages primarily from other sources. Study authors also mention the possibility that FlyBuy cards were not used for all purchases. Neither the purchasing data from the FlyBuys cards nor the self-reported consumption data therefore seem to be sufficiently reliable"
Q,The number of women who did not receive the intervention according to allocation was not evenly distributed between the groups
N,"The original design was amended by addition of a ’lateral entry procedure’ to allow first-episode participants to enter the second year after the initial first year of maintenance treatment’.

Lorazepam was provided by Wyeth-Pharma Rating scales: conducted by a study physician at every visit"
Q,"The outcome measures may be an imperfect measure for the actual SSB intake of the target population. Quote: ""We requested data for all 17 full-service chain supermarkets in the county, but 2 retailers would not release data, leaving a sample of 15 HC stores. We purchased scanner data for the top-selling brands from the 3 largest beverage companies (Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group) in the regular soda (13 brands), sports drink (2 brands), and diet soda (7 brands) categories. We also purchased data for the brands with the highest sales in the 100% juice (4 brands) and fruit drink (6 brands) categories. (...) [T]hese data do not tell us what people are drinking instead of the brands included in the study. The beverage industry is transforming quickly, and new products are introduced each year. We focused on the best-selling major brands within each category to ensure we could measure the same products each year. However, HC consumers may have shifted to beverages from small companies that are marketed as healthy alternatives, such as organic sodas or low-sugar iced teas. Future work should follow the sales of these smaller brands in the HC and comparison stores to determine whether consumers are shifting to other products and, in turn, how sugar intake from beverages has changed"""
Q,The patients were mostly female and of low education
Q,The potential for cross-group contamination in this study was unclear. There was one nurse providing both the intervention and control therapies. The possible interactions between participants was unclear
N,The prevalence of previous opportunistic infections was higher in patients allocated to the pegylated liposomal doxorubicin group
N,The proportion of participants receiving antibiotic treatment increased from 2005; there might be important differences between groups especially before this time. Study not really able to detect differences between treatment + surgery and surgery alone. 24/133 (18%) of participants had comorbidities that may have affected healing.
N,"The results of the calculation of the best-fit counterfactual seem unrealistic,as they imply that calories purchased as beverages from HWCF brands wouldfall to zero by 2013 (2012 for carbonated soL drinks, see Figure FA and Appen-dix Figure C3a of the study's primary report).

In addition, while small purchases fromconvenience stores should be documented by the household, these purchas-es are generally omitted from most households’ scanning activity.

N,"There was some baseline imbalance. Patients randomised to CXT but not receiving chemotherapy had low baseline CD4 counts (median, 77 cells/ml), compared with those receiving chemotherapy (median, 249 cells/ml). When ABV was not available, oral Etoposide was given. This alternative chemotherapy regimen was used in 31% of patients that received chemotherapy overall."
N,There was some leakage. 10% of control communities got food
Q,"There were baseline imbalances between the groups, but results were adjusted. Unclear risk of recruitment bias as individuals were recruited to the trial after clusters have been randomised"
Q,"There were baseline imbalances for certain characteristics between the conditions (e.g. servings of legumes), although adjusted for in the analysis and so the impact of this is unclear. Analysis did not accounted for effect of clustering, but we calculated an effective sample size prior to pooling in meta-analysis to account for this"
N,"There were important differences in baseline characteristics mainly due to 1 centre (Bangkok) where women in the electrocoagulation group were older, had more living children and had been married longer. Also, women in the Pomeroy group were lighter and had a lower ponderal index, mainly due to the contribution of 2 centres (Bangkok and Havana).These differences were statistically significant for the Bangkok centre"
N,There were inconsistencies in the data between the 2 reports of the same study.
Q,There were more patients in the IVIG group with post-operative complications
Q,There were more patients with DIC in the placebo group but subgroup analysis showed no significant difference in mortality rate. Interim analysis was done after about half of the target population had completed the trial. The study was terminated by the sponsor after the Safety and Efficacy Monitoring Board determined that the likelihood of reaching a statistically significant difference in outcome for the primary objective was low.
Q,There were more septic abortions and surgical interventions in the control group
N,There were no differences according to group allocation at baseline. However at high risk of incorrect analysis as the protocol specifies that clustering within
N,There were no differences at baseline in parent and child characteristics except for % of parents older than 30 years. There is no mention that this was adjusted for in the analysis

P,"Took a long time to include enough participants, from 1997-2004. Recruitment stopped at 717, only 599 women actually received the allocated treatment. 95 fewer than required by the power calculation. In the flow chart it is stated that 1047 were assessed for eligibility while only 717 were randomised. The main reason for not randomising was that midwives were too busy. It is difficult to know if this introduced bias. It was difficult to differentiate between intact perineum and trauma. The classification of the degree of perineal trauma makes it difficult to compare to other studies."

N,"We noted unit of analysis issues, as the outcome of ABI was reported with the lower limbs rather than patients as the unit of analysis, and study authors did not adjust their data to account for the effect of clustering."
N,"Whether informed consent was obtained is unclear, and the funding source was not stated."
N,"While the graphical presentation of results strengthens our confidence that effects were due to the intervention, and cannot be explained with underlying temporal trends, these were not taken into account in analyses. In 1 of the 3 intervention schools, chocolate milk purchases seem to have reverted to baseline levels towards the end of the study period. The authors conduct a statistical process management (SPM) analysis, which differs from classical ITS analyses. Seasonality may have influenced outcomes, but it is unlikely that it explains the existence and direction of the effect. Quote: ""Even though the dates of introduction are staggered, the effect is similar at each school suggesting that time of year is not a factor in PP selection"""
