Reason for identical numbers assigned to the two groups: [We assigned 
odd and even numbers to interventions A and B, respectively. After initial 
assignment of participants, if the number assigned to A was greater than 
the number assigned to B, we used the following procedure to ensure that 
an equal number of participants was assigned to each group. We used the 
subsequent number in the random number table (e.g. 55), divided that 
number by 30 to obtain a natural number and a remainder (e.g. 55/30 = 1 
with a remainder of 25), and used the remainder to reassign a participant 
from the larger group to the smaller group (e.g. assigned the 25th 
participant in group A to group B).] 
The first author described a procedure involving nonrandom manipulation of 
assignments to balance sample sizes, which may have introduced selection 
bias."

Certain children could not be included in the randomization for sedation and these 253 (28%) were excluded from the study protocol for the following reasons ...” ""An alternating assignment for outpatients and a rotational assignment for inpatients helped to reduce the chance of selecting a particular method for a particular patient. For outpatients, the sedation regimen was assigned when the patient arrived for CT, using an alternating list kept at the scheduling desk. In the case of a sedation failure, this was recorded, and upon the child’s return for a second trial, the number for the next-in-line alternate type of sedation was assigned. When both sedation regimens failed for outpatients, general anesthesia was usually given, but not as part of the inpatient randomization. For inpatients, the rotational assignment included general anesthesia but generally only one sedation was tried before resorting to general anesthesia.” Randomisation via alternating and rotational assignments, thus risk of bias was high."

Q,Villages were selected by lottery until an approximate sample size of 1200 households per study arm was achieved. Assignment of clusters not clear.
P,"We contacted the corresponding author Lisa Harnack to obtain additional information on the randomisation procedure, which is not described in detail in the study's published report.

P,"We contacted the study's corresponding author for additional information on the randomisation procedure, which is not described in detail in the study’s published report. We received the answer that participants were listed in alphabetical order and then randomly assigned to the IG and CG with a table of random numbers from a statistics textbook, with odd numbers assigned to 1 group, and even numbers assigned to the other group"
