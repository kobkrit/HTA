P,"The attending surgeon, assistants and patients were unaware of the content of the solution, which had been prepared by an operating room nurse"
Q,The authors did not clearly state whether blinding was used or not
P,"The authors did not describe whether the patients were blinded or not. However, they clearly reported that ""the CT images were appraised by two observers who did not know which patient received erythromycin therapy"". Therefore, we considered that the outcome assessors were blinded. The nonblinding of participants was unlikely to introduce bias as the results were objectively assessed by outcome assessors"
Q,The authors did not mention whether the blinding method was used or not
N,"The authors did not state whether the outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation, however blinding seems unlikely, as the modality of intervention was completely different (chloral hydrate given orally or music therapy with music therapist). As the outcomes collected included child’s level of sleep/sedation during procedure, time to achieve sleep/sedation, and length of sleep/ sedation, some of which required a subjective assessment, non-blinding of personnel could have influenced the care of the participants and outcomes. Medical residents or music therapy interns who recorded the outcome data were not blinded to the allocation, as they collected the data before, during, and after the EEG procedure, which would have included witnessing the music therapy taking place."
P,The authors do not report if the assessment was blinded. However as the outcomes are death and viral load lack of blinding is unlikely to be a major source of bias.

N,The nurse-midwives were informed about which group (control or experimental) the woman was allocated to by the researcher when the woman was in the expulsive period
P,The observer was masked
P,"The outcome (mean grams of cookies eaten) was objectively assessed, so that blinding of outcome assessment was not applicable in this study"
P,"The outcome (mean number of drinks sold) was objectively obtained from electronic data, so that blinding of outcome assessment was not applicable in this study"
P,"The outcome (proportion of high energy drinks and snacks purchased) was objectively obtained from electronic data, so that blinding of outcome assessment was not applicable in this study"
Q,"The outcome assessment was done by the midwife who performed the birth, and thus not blinded, but to counter this potential bias, a random 25% of the study births had a 2nd midwife observer present (additional information by contact with the study author)"
N,"The outcome assessments (WOMAC pain, function and total) were made by the participants themselves, by completing questionnaires; because the participants knew which group they were in, they could not be blind for outcome assessment."
P,"The outcome of the healing process was evaluated by 2 independent assessors, who were not involved in the surgical procedure"
P,"The parents, physicians, and investigators did not know the content of the preparation that was dispensed. Interventions were packed in small plastic containers marked A, B, C, and D and distributed to the paediatric community clinics. Silan date extract was used as a placebo because its structure, brown colour, and taste are similar to that of honey."

N,"The primary outcome was the BDI, which is a self report measure"
P,The project was blinded in that the physician who saw the the patients for the initial examination and the 4-month followup did not know which group each patient was in. The same physician saw all the patients in both groups throughout the study. The blinding was broken in about 10% of the cases
P,The radiologist was blinded about the study and groups of participants.

Q,"The risk of bias in the primary outcome measure of neurocognitive function is likely low as the manuscript reports that the examiners administering the neuropsychological tests were blinded to the medication received, but the blinding procedure was not described. Patient self-evaluation on cognitive function is highly biased as they were not blinded to their treatment."
N,The same investigator performed all measurements and was presumably unmasked to treatment assignment
N,The self-completed questionnaire introduced a possible bias

P,"Vaccinators took no further part in the study and did not participate in follow-up data collection, so outcome assessment was double-blind"
P,Vaccine and placebo syringes were identical in appearance except for the allocation numbers.
Q,"Vegetable and fruit intake: 2 observers independently recorded the number of pieces of vegetables or fruit selected by each child. However it is unclear whether these observers were blinded to condition and whether this influenced detection bias. This was observation of the number of pieces of fruit or veg selected and eaten by each child, and weight of any uneaten pieces of fruit/veg on the plate at end of meal. It was assessed by 2 independent observers, but it is not clear if they were blinded or not. Childcare staff sat at table with children and passed around fruit & veg bowls but were unaware of the study hypotheses"
P,Vegetable consumption: Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to influence detection bias
P,"Vegetable crisps intake (objective): The outcome was vegetable chip and dip intake (each assessed separately) by weighing amount before and after consumption. It is not clear who (i.e. researchers or daycare centre staff) weighed the chips & dip, and whether or not they were blinded. Blinding of outcome assessors unlikely to influence outcome"
P,Vegetable intake (objective measure): Children’s vegetable intake was measured by weighing their plates before and after dinner (left-overs). There is a low risk of detection bias
P,Vegetable intake (objective) Food was weighed to determine intake and staff were blinded to the target vegetable being offered to the children
P,"Vegetable intake (objective) Food was weighed to determine intake, but it is unlikely to be influenced by whether the researchers were blinded to condition"
P,Vegetable intake (objective): Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and whether those who weighed the food were blinded is unlikely to have an impact on detection bias
P,Vegetable intake (objective): Outcome was pre-post weight of soup bowl assessed by researcher. Researchers were not blinded to group allocation (as they served the soup (2 x green soups varying in energy intake)) and researcher was not present in room during consumption of soup
Q,"Vegetable intake (weighed):Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to be influenced by detection bias Parent reported fruit and vegetable consumption:There is no blinding to group allocation of participants or personnel described and these are self-reported measures. However, “Researchers did not inform parents regarding which foods were presented to the children.”"
P,Vegetable intake The experimenter counted the number of pieces of each snack eaten and therefore given it is an objective measure unlikely to be influenced by detection bias
N,Vegetable intake was determined by weighing vegetables and therefore low risk of detection bias.
P,Vegetable intake: Intake was weighed and therefore it is unlikely that this would be influenced by detection bias
P,Vegetable intake: Objective measure of child’s vegetable intake and unlikely to be influenced by detection bias
P,Vegetable intake: Researchers recorded the number of pieces of each food item taken by the child and it is unlikely that this would be influenced by detection bias
N,Vegetable intake: There is no mention that the parents were blinded and they were cutting and offering the pieces to the child and so at high risk of detection bias
P,"Vegetable intake: This is objective assessment. Parents would be unable to determine study group from feeding the child, and therefore this would be unlikely to influence the outcome"
