P,"Materials and methods: “Two strawberry-flavoured chloral hydrate syrups containing 70 or 100mg/ml were prepared by the pharmacy department.” As described above,allocation concealment occurred as chloral hydrate medication of 2 different concentrations of the same flavour were made by pharmacy."
Q,"Materials and methods', 'Randomisation procedure': """"Each patient requiring at least one catheter was randomly allocated to one of two groups by drawing envelopes from an urn."" It was unclear who drew the envelopes and when. It was also unclear whether the envelops were sealed and opaque. If the envelop was drawn by the investigator involved in the enrolment, there was a high risk of violating allocation concealment, for example, by redrawing."

Similarly cards with group-A/B written over them were put inside sequentially numbered envelopes by matching with odd/even random numbers as generated by computer. 1st patient for the clinical trial was allocated to the group assigned to the envelope no-001, 2nd patient was allotted to the group assigned to the envelope no.002. In this way 200 participants were allocated into 2 intervention groups and eventually the numbers in 2 groups were 100 in group A and 100 in group B"

N,Study authors replied that no allocation concealment was attempted
P,"Study authors reported ""...and the applicator number was assigned through an interactive voice response system..."""
Q,Study co-ordinators assigned treatment numbers to participants entering the 12-week double-blind treatment period
Q,"Study nurse used opaque envelopes, prepared in advance by project director"
P,"Study physicians, research staF, participants, and data analysts were unaware of allocation due to central randomisation and coding. Emergency unblinding envelopes were available, but study sites did not report opening any of them."
P,"Subjects and methods: “The trial used computer generated equal randomization and allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Randomisation was done by a computer generated random number list and blinding was done by employing an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. Data collectors, outcome assessors and data analysts were all kept blinded to the allocation but the interventionists (EEG staff). The trial adhered to established procedures to maintain separation between person who took outcome assessment and staff that delivered the intervention. The drug was delivered by EEG staff and primary and secondary outcomes were assessed by the resident of research who was not informed of the drug group assignment. Investigators, staff and participants were all kept masked to outcome measurements and trial results."""

P,Telephone inquiry
P,Telephone inquiry
P,Telephone-based electronic interactive voice response system

Q,The authors do not give any details about allocation concealment
P,"The block length was not known to the investigator. Each investigator received a set of blocks with correspondingly numbered study medication. Eligible patients were sequentially allocated to a patient number in ascending order on entry in the trial, p.53"
P,The code was held and syringes used for both groups were identical in appearance.
P,The coin was 'spun' at the beginning of the operation. Allocation would have been concealed until then and the next allocation would be unpredictable
P,"The coin was flipped before surgery. After performing the conventional surgical technique (i.e. apicoectomy and root-end filling), operators were given an envelope, which disclosed to which group the participant they were operating on belonged"
P,The coordinator [when assigning patients to therapists] was completely blind to which therapists were treating patients with ICF goal outcome and which were giving usual care' (author communication)
Q,The description of the timing of randomisation does not provide reliable information that it was concealed
P,"The envelope was opened at the time of placement of the root-end filling. On a label, the name of the filling material was written"

Q,The method of allocation concealment was not described
Q,The method of concealment was not described.
Q,"The method of concealment was not described.

P,The random number was held by a departmental secretary who was not directly involved in the trial
N,The randomisation failed in this trial as several families allocated to video-conference-based family counselling (VFC) were unable to support it technically and were offered speakerphone family counselling as an alternative (SFC)
Q,"The randomisation sequence was provided to sites, using sealed, sequentially labelled opaque envelopes"
Q,The randomisation was concealed from the surgeon until before the start of the operation. No further details are given
P,"The randomization sequences were concealed to the research personnel who recruited, measured, and treated patients. Two researchers, not involved in these procedures, generated the randomization sequences and stored them in a place not accessible for other research personnel. When a patient was recruited at any of the three centres and baseline measures were completed and registered, the recruiting personnel phoned the researcher with access to the randomizations sequences and got the allocation for this particular patient according to the randomization list' (author communication)"
P,The research staff involved in recruiting participants to the study and allocating them to general practitioners were blinded to the allocation of clusters to intervention or control conditions (author communication)
P,The schedule was kept in an envelope in a locked drawer and was used only by the project coordinator (p. 606)
P,The sequence of randomisation was concealed until the participant was assigned to a group.
P,"The sequence was delivered to the Serum Institute of India, Pune, India, where it was used to label the vaccine and placebo syringes, which were identical in appearance except for the allocation numbers."
